# MQTT Hierarchical Network - Implementation Guide

## Architecture Overview

This implementation creates a robust hierarchical MQTT network using:

- **5 Mosquitto brokers** in Multipass VMs with static IPs
- **Nginx load balancer** with health checks for transparent failover
- **Health monitoring service** that tracks broker status and manages failover
- **Full mesh bridging** between all brokers for complete message replication
- **Web dashboard** for real-time monitoring
- **Automated testing suite** for comprehensive validation

## Key Features Implemented

### Your Requirements Met

1. **Hierarchical Network**: Broker 1 is primary, 2-5 are sequential backups
2. **Full Message Replication**: All brokers bridge to each other
3. **Retained Messages**: Synchronized across the network
4. **Session Persistence**: Via message replication (not shared storage)
5. **Client Failover**: Transparent via Nginx load balancer
6. **Automatic Recovery**: Brokers rejoin network with exponential backoff
7. **Health Monitoring**: Nginx health checks trigger failover
8. **Testing Suite**: 5-minute tests with 60s failure/recovery cycles

### Technical Implementation

- **Message Loop Prevention**: Bridge configurations with `try_private false` and `cleansession true`
- **Load Balancing**: Nginx stream module with least_conn and backup servers

## Detailed Component Guide

### MQTT Brokers (broker1-5)

**Static IP Addresses:**
- Broker 1 (Primary): 192.168.100.10
- Broker 2: 192.168.100.11
- Broker 3: 192.168.100.12
- Broker 4: 192.168.100.13
- Broker 5: 192.168.100.14

**Configuration Features:**
- Full mesh bridging to all other brokers
- Retained message support
- Session persistence
- Health reporting to monitoring topics
- Automatic bridge reconnection with exponential backoff

**Bridge Configuration Example:**
```
connection broker2
address 192.168.100.11:1883
topic # both 0 local/ remote/
try_private false
cleansession true
restart_timeout 30
```

### Nginx Load Balancer

**Configuration:**
- **MQTT Port**: 1883 (transparent to clients)
- **Health API**: 8080
- **Dashboard Proxy**: 8080 â†’ 3000
- **Load Balancing**: least_conn with priority weights
- **Health Checks**: TCP checks with fail_timeout=30s

**Failover Logic:**
```
upstream mqtt_brokers {
    server 192.168.100.10:1883 weight=5 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s;
    server 192.168.100.11:1883 weight=4 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s backup;
    server 192.168.100.12:1883 weight=3 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s backup;
    server 192.168.100.13:1883 weight=2 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s backup;
    server 192.168.100.14:1883 weight=1 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s backup;
}
```

### Health Monitoring Service

**Features:**
- **MQTT Health Monitoring**: Subscribes to broker health topics
- **TCP Health Checks**: Direct socket connections to broker ports
- **Client Status Tracking**: Monitors client connections and status
- **RESTful API**: Provides health data for dashboard and external tools
- **Nginx Integration**: Can update upstream configurations (planned)

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /brokers` - Current broker status
- `GET /clients` - Connected client information
- `GET /tcp-check` - Direct TCP health check results

### Web Dashboard

**Real-time Features:**
- **Broker Status**: Online/offline status with connection counts
- **Network Topology**: Visual representation of broker hierarchy
- **Client Connections**: Active client tracking
- **System Metrics**: Health service status and statistics
- **Live Updates**: WebSocket-based real-time updates every 2 seconds

**Dashboard Sections:**
- Network topology visualization
- Broker status grid with metrics
- Client connection list
- System health overview
- TCP health check results

### Client Examples

**Failover Client (`failover-client.py`):**
- Connects via Nginx load balancer (transparent failover)
- Publishes client status to monitoring topics
- Handles automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Supports sensor and control client simulations

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Run basic test client
python3 client-examples/python/failover-client.py

# Run sensor simulation
python3 client-examples/python/failover-client.py sensor

# Run control client simulation
python3 client-examples/python/failover-client.py control
```

### Testing Suite

**Test Categories:**

1. **Connectivity Tests**: Verify all brokers and load balancer are accessible
2. **Message Replication**: Confirm messages propagate across all brokers
3. **Retained Messages**: Test retained message synchronization
4. **Failover Scenarios**: Simulate broker failures and recovery

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh full

# Run specific test
./scripts/run-tests.sh connectivity
./scripts/run-tests.sh replication
./scripts/run-tests.sh retained
./scripts/run-tests.sh failover

# Run client simulation
./scripts/run-tests.sh clients 600  # 10 minutes
```

**Test Results:**
- JSON logs in `logs/` directory
- HTML reports generated automatically
- Success/failure rates calculated
- Detailed error information captured

## Advanced Configuration

### Message Loop Prevention

The system prevents message loops through:

1. **Bridge Configuration**:
   ```
   try_private false    # Don't create private bridges
   cleansession true    # Clean session for bridges
   ```

2. **Topic Prefixes** (if needed):
   ```
   topic sensors/# out 0 local/ remote/
   topic commands/# in 0 remote/ local/
   ```

### Session Persistence Strategy

Instead of shared storage, the system uses:
- **Message replication** across all brokers
- **Client status topics** for session tracking
- **Retained messages** for state persistence
- **Connection state publishing** by clients

### Scaling Considerations

**Adding More Brokers:**
1. Update `BROKERS` array in health service
2. Add VM configuration in deploy script
3. Update Nginx upstream configuration
4. Regenerate bridge configurations

**Performance Tuning:**
- Adjust `max_connections` in Mosquitto configs
- Tune Nginx `worker_connections`
- Modify health check intervals
- Configure QoS levels appropriately

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**1. Brokers Not Starting**
```bash
# Check VM status
multipass list

# Check individual broker
multipass info broker1

# SSH into broker to debug
multipass shell broker1
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
sudo journalctl -u mosquitto -f
```

**2. Load Balancer Not Working**
```bash
# Test Nginx configuration
sudo nginx -t

# Check Nginx status
sudo nginx -s reload

# Test MQTT port
nc -z localhost 1883
```

**3. Health Service Issues**
```bash
# Check health service logs
tail -f logs/health-service.log

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/health
curl http://localhost:5000/brokers
```

**4. Dashboard Not Loading**
```bash
# Check dashboard logs
tail -f logs/dashboard.log

# Verify Node.js dependencies
cd dashboard && npm install

# Test dashboard directly
cd dashboard && npm start
```

### Log Locations

- **Broker Logs**: `/var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log` (in VMs)
- **Health Service**: `logs/health-service.log`
- **Dashboard**: `logs/dashboard.log`
- **Nginx**: `/var/log/nginx/`
- **Test Results**: `logs/test-results/`

### Performance Monitoring

**Monitor Broker Load:**
```bash
# SSH into broker
multipass shell broker1

# Check process stats
top | grep mosquitto

# Check network connections
netstat -an | grep 1883

# Check log for errors
tail -f /var/log/mosquitto/mosquitto.log
```

**Monitor Network Traffic:**
```bash
# On host machine
netstat -an | grep 1883

# Check load balancer stats
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Production Considerations

### Security Enhancements

   - Use OAuth2/JWT tokens

3. **Network Security**:
   - Firewall rules for broker IPs
   - VPN for broker communication
   - Network segmentation

### High Availability

1. **Geographic Distribution**:
   - Deploy brokers across different data centers
   - Configure WAN-optimized bridges
   - Implement disaster recovery procedures

2. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana
   - Configure alerting for broker failures
   - Set up log aggregation (ELK stack)

3. **Backup & Recovery**:
