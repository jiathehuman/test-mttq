MQTT Broker Health Monitoring and Load Balancer Management Service

This service provides comprehensive health monitoring for a distributed MQTT broker cluster
and manages the nginx load balancer configuration dynamically based on broker availability.

Key responsibilities:
- Continuous health monitoring of all MQTT brokers in the cluster
- TCP connectivity validation to ensure brokers are reachable
- MQTT protocol-level health checks with publish/subscribe validation
- Dynamic management of nginx upstream server configuration
- RESTful API endpoints for external monitoring and integration
- Real-time client connection tracking and reporting
- Centralized logging and metrics collection for operational visibility

The service implements a multi-threaded architecture with separate workers for:
- MQTT health monitoring (protocol-level validation)
- TCP health checking (network-level validation)
- HTTP API server (external interface)
- Broker status broadcasting (cluster communication)

Architecture: Multi-threaded Python service with Flask HTTP API
Dependencies: paho-mqtt, Flask, requests
